Dining Philosophers Project

The Dining Philosopher Problem states that K philosophers seated around a circular table with one chopstick between each pair of philosophers. There is one chopstick between each
philosopher. Philosophers are either thinking or eating. Whenever a philosopher wishes to
eat, s/he first needs to find two chopsticks. S/he may eat if he can pick up the two chopsticks
adjacent to him. One chopstick may be picked up by any one of its adjacent followers but not
both. If the hungry philosopher does not have two chopsticks (i.e. one or two of her neighbors
already picked up the chopstick) s/he will have to wait until both chopsticks are available.
When a philosopher finishes eating, s/he puts down both chopsticks to their original places,
and resumes thinking. There is an infinite amount of food on their plate, so they only need
to worry about the chopsticks.


• Philosophers are either thinking or eating. They do not talk to each other.

• Philosophers can only fetch chopsticks placed between them and their neighbors.

• Philosophers cannot take their neighbors’ chopsticks away while they are eating.
